/**
 * @title A temple investment vault, allows deposits and withdrawals on a set period (eg. monthly)
 *
 * @notice Each vault is a rebasing ERC2O (token representing an accounts vault share), Vaults have a
 * cycle period, and a join/exit period. During the join/exit period, a vault account can withdraw their
 * share of temple from the vault, or deposit more temple in.
 *
 * Depending on when an account joins a vault, there is a linearly increasing joining fee shared by all
 * other vault accounts.
 *
 * If an account doesn't leave during the join/exit period, their holdings are automaticaly re-invested
 * into the next vault cycle.
