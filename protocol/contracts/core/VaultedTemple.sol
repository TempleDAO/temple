/**
 * @title All temple in all vaults
 *
 * @dev A vault doesn't hold any temple, it holds a synthetic exposure
 * (Temple Exposure). The same as all other exposures.
 *
 * One key difference is this temple is accessible by the protocol
 * to use as collateral on lending platforms to give leverage to
 * our farming strategies.
 *
 * This is also an Exposure's liquidator, as a vault, when a user
 * is withdrawing will liquidate it's temple exposure and return
 * it the user.
 *
 * This implies a simple precondition. There is always sufficient
 * free temple in this contract to allow all vaults in their
 * exit/entry window to withdraw all deposited temple.
 *
 * All other temple is now available as collateral for the protocol
 * to use in lending platforms.
 *
 * This version has a manual method in which to withdraw temple,
 * eventually, we expect to automate this as we bake in the temple
 * dao leverage strategy.
