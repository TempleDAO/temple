      <h2>8. International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Your Personal Data may be processed in jurisdictions outside your home

        providers operate. We take reasonable steps to ensure appropriate
        safeguards consistent with Applicable Law.

      <h2>9. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>

        We may use cookies and similar technologies for security, functionality,

      <h2>10. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary for the purposes
