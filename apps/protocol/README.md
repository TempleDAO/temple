# TempleDAO Protocol

## Dev Setup
```
nvm use
yarn
yarn test
```


## Rinkeby Deployment
```
export RINKEBY_ADDRESS_PRIVATE_KEY=...  # export from metamask 
export RINKEBY_RPC_URL=... 		# grab RPC url from metamask or create a relayer on alchemy

hardhat:testnet run scripts/deploys/rinkeby/{your-script-name}
```

Once successfully deployed on testnet, verify contract source on etherscan. If you use the `deployAndMine` helper when creating your
script, it will spit out the relevant command. It will look something like this

```
yarn hardhat verify --network rinkeby 0x359655dcB8A32479680Af81Eb38eA3Bb2B42Af54 
```

It's fine to have multiple versions of a contract on rinkeby, so it's okay to run before your PR is merged (and re-run if there are any
comments on the PR on how to best setup the deploy scripts.

You can also run and test locally by replacing `yarn hardhat:testnet` with `yarn hardhat:local`. You'll probably have to run some of the previous deploys
in order to setup the right local state
